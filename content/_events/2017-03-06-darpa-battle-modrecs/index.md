# DARPA Battle of the ModRecs

Official competition website: [http://dyspan2017.ieee-dyspan.org/workshop/ieee-dyspan-2017-workshop-battle-modrecs](http://dyspan2017.ieee-dyspan.org/workshop/ieee-dyspan-2017-workshop-battle-modrecs)

“Battle of the ModRecs” is a live competition-like event. A single open-air transmit system based on, but not identical to, the Entrance Hurdles for the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge ([https://spectrumcollaborationchallenge.com/documents/](https://spectrumcollaborationchallenge.com/documents/)) will be set up to generate and cycle through various modulations. Each participant will set up their system to receive the signals over the air and perform their modulation recognition (“ModRec”) algorithms. The Battle of the ModRecs seeks to explore the field of modulation recognition to better understand how to approach these problems and, most importantly, to compare results.

The Battle is separated into a workshop and a live over-the-air event. The workshop will take place during the DySPAN workshop day of March 6. The Battle will take place between March 7 and 8 during the technical conference. During conference hours, the transmitter will operate on a pre-set frequency and bandwidth which will be dictated by an experimental FCC license. The competition signal generator will transmit certain types of modulated signals among a frequency-time grid with defined channel bandwidths and time slot durations. Battle participants will capture the signals and identify the modulation for as many signals as possible in the established grid.
