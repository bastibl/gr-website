# July 2016 Dev Call

The July 2016 dev call will take place on Thu 21 July, at 1 PM Eastern (GMT -4:00).

&nbsp;

We do calls using Google Hangout, on our &#8220;Google+ Group&#8221;: [https://plus.google.com/communities/105194615257651755927](https://plus.google.com/communities/105194615257651755927). Make sure to install the [hangout plugin](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/hangoutplugin).

Calls are always managed through IRC. If you want to join, also join #gnuradio.

The call is usually announced long before the call. So click &#8216;Join&#8217;, then you will get your own button to join the hangout.

If you just want to listen in, there will be a stream of the call available. In this case, please don&#8217;t join the call, because there is a limit of users.

We use &#8220;MeetBot&#8221;: [http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot](https://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot) (Fleischautomat) to help us with the minutes. Don&#8217;t be shy, use the MeetBot commands (#info, #agreed, #link) generously.
