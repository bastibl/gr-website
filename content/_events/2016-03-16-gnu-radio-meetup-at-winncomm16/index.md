# GNU Radio Meetup at WinnComm&#8217;16

In conjunction with the WinnComm&#8217;16 conference, developers and team members of the GNU Radio project will be holding a meetup at the American Tap Room in Reston Town center starting at 7:30 on Tuesday, March 15. This is an informal social event to meet, greet, discuss, get to know us and fellow GNU Radio users, and generally have a good time. Punctuality is not important and there will be no formal seating or organized dinner. Just come by when you can for however long you wish.
