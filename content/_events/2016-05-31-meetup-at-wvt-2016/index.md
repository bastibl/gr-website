[Philip Balister](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-balister-426b8b4) is once again hosting a meetup in conjunction with the [Wireless @ VT Symposium](https://wireless.vt.edu/symposium2016.html)! Because it is hosted at his house, we will not be posting a location here on the website. Please contact Philip by e-mailing him (`philip` at `opensdr` dot `com`)Â to RSVP for the event and get directions, and we hope to see you there!
