# FOSDEM 2017

Dear friends and fans of software defined radio,

next year&#8217;s FOSDEM (the free and open source developer&#8217;s meeting in<br />
Brussels, Europe) will, once again, feature a  track on Software Defined<br />
Radio.<br />
Therefore, we invite developers and users from the free software radio<br />
community to join us for this track and present your talks or demos.

Software Radio has become an important tool to allow anyone access the<br />
EM spectrum. Using free software radio libraries and applications and<br />
cheap  hardware, anyone can now start hacking on wireless<br />
communications, remote sensing, radar or other applications. At FOSDEM,<br />
we hope to network all these projects and improve collaboration, bring<br />
new ideas forward and get more people involved.

The track&#8217;s web site resides at:<br />
[http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/FOSDEM](https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/FOSDEM)

Here, we will publish updates and announcements. The final schedule will<br />
be available through Pentabarf and the official FOSDEM website.

** Submit your presentations

To suggest a talk, go to [https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM16](https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM16)<br />
and follow the instructions (you need an account, but can use your<br />
account from last year if you have one). You need to create an &#8216;Event&#8217;;<br />
make sure it&#8217;s in the Software Defined Radio track! Lengths aren&#8217;t<br />
fixed, but give a realistic estimate and please don&#8217;t exceed 30 minutes<br />
unless you have something special planned (in that case, contact one of<br />
us). Also, don&#8217;t forget to include time for Q&#038;A.

You aren&#8217;t limited to slide presentations, of course. Be creative.<br />
However, FOSDEM is an open source conference, therefore we ask you to<br />
stay clear of marketing presentations. Of course, we like nitty-gritty<br />
technical stuff.

Here&#8217;s a list of topics that will most likely be included:<br />
&#8211; SDR Frameworks + Tools<br />
&#8211; Wireless security<br />
&#8211; Radio hardware<br />
&#8211; Telecommunications<br />
&#8211; Random fun wireless hacks

We will reserve time for interactiveness, it won&#8217;t all be talks.

** Important Dates

FOSDEM is February 4th and 5th, 2017.

* December 9th 2016: Submission Deadline<br />
* January 2nd 2017: Announcement of final schedule<br />
* February 4th 2017: SDR Track (Saturday)

These dates are not set in stone. However, the least years we were<br />
always full to the brim with presentations, so if you want to present,<br />
please make sure to submit your abstracts soon!

** Steering Committee

The track committee consists of:<br />
* Phil &#8220;catvideos&#8221; Balister (OpenEmbedded / OpenSDR)<br />
* Martin &#8220;mbr0wn&#8221; Braun (GNU Radio)<br />
* Sylvain &#8220;tnt&#8221; Munaut (OsmoCom)

Hope to hear from you soon! And please forward this announcement.
