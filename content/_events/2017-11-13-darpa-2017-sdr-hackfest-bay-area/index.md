# DARPA 2017 Bay Area SDR Hackfest

The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, is pleased to host the DARPA Bay Area SDR Hackfest. The Hackfest will take place on November 13–17, 2017, at the NASA Ames Conference Center. The physical and cyber worlds are becoming inseparable. Computers, home appliances, vehicles, cameras, and the myriad handheld devices upon which we all now depend are wirelessly connected to each other and to ourselves, with each system striving to achieve its respective mission in an ever more congested electromagnetic (EM) space. This Hackfest is designed to explore and better understand the complex relationships we are creating within the EM spectrum, and examine in particular the cyber-physical intersection of software defined radio (SDR) and remotely piloted aircraft.

The Hackfest is a 3-part event, with an exciting speaker series, an open hacker space, and a by-application Missions portion, where teams will participate in a week-long hack-a-thon to solve specified problems using SDRs to control UAVs.

See you in Mountain View!
